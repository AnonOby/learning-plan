### 1. Goal Clarification and Breakdown (Approx. 4h)

**1.1 Review the Core Goals from the Final Plan**

- Goal 1: Reach a professional level in economics (_l’économie_, feminine) and full-stack development (_le développement full-stack_, masculine) through self-study during undergraduate years.
- Goal 2: No graduate school; secure employment directly after graduation.
    
- Goal 3: Earn an annual salary of $150,000 before age 35 and relocate to France or some other French-speaking developed country.
    

> **Tools & Output**: Create a “Long-Term Goals” page in Notion/Obsidian and list the above three goals, using colors to distinguish them.

**1.2 Define Milestones**

- **Year 1 (may 2026)**: Master intermediate economic theory; complete at least two real-world full-stack projects; build a quality GitHub portfolio.
    
- **Year 2 (may 2027)**: Dive into topics like econometrics (_l’économétrie_, feminine) and cloud deployment (_le déploiement dans le cloud_, masculine); contribute to open source; publish blog posts or educational videos.
    

> **Template**: Use tables in a task management app to list phase goals, success criteria, and estimated time commitments.
