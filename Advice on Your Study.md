Here’s a hard-nosed, zero-fluff roadmap to build the rock-solid math foundation you need to thrive in both economics (économie (f)) and computer science (informatique (f)):

## 1. Core Mathematical Pillars

You need five pillars. Hit each one, don’t skip.

1. **Calculus (calcul (m))**
    
    - **Single-variable**: limits, derivatives, integrals.
        
    - **Multi-variable**: partial derivatives, multiple integrals, gradient, Jacobian.
        
    - **Why**: optimization in econometrics, back-prop in ML.
        
    - **Resource**: MIT OCW “Single Variable Calculus” & “Multivariable Calculus.”
        
2. **Linear Algebra (algèbre linéaire (f))**
    
    - Vectors, matrices, eigenvalues/vectors, SVD.
        
    - **Why**: principal component analysis, graph algorithms, neural nets.
        
    - **Resource**: “Linear Algebra Done Right” (Axler) + 3Blue1Brown’s “Essence of Linear Algebra.”
        
3. **Probability & Statistics (probabilités (f) et statistiques (f))**
    
    - Distributions, expectation, variance, law of large numbers, central limit theorem.
        
    - Regression, hypothesis testing, maximum likelihood.
        
    - **Why**: empirical econ, A/B testing, probabilistic models in CS.
        
    - **Resource**: Khan Academy + “Introduction to Probability” (Dimitri Bertsekas).
        
4. **Discrete Mathematics (mathématiques discrètes (f))**
    
    - Logic, proofs, set theory, combinatorics, graph theory.
        
    - **Why**: algorithms, cryptography, complexity.
        
    - **Resource**: MIT OCW “Mathematics for Computer Science.”
        
5. **Optimization (optimisation (f))**
    
    - Convex sets/functions, Lagrange multipliers, gradient methods, KKT conditions.
        
    - **Why**: constrained optimization in microeconomics, training ML models.
        
    - **Resource**: Boyd & Vandenberghe’s “Convex Optimization” (chapters 1–5).

## 2. 12-Month Study Timeline

Aim ~8 hours/week on math if you can spare 50 hours total; ramp up when needed.

|Quarter|Focus|Deliverable|
|---|---|---|
|**Months 1–3**|Calculus + Linear Algebra basics|Problem sets + mini-project (e.g., optimize a simple function)|
|**Months 4–6**|Probability & Statistics|Data analysis report in R or Python|
|**Months 7–9**|Discrete Math + Proof Techniques|Implement graph algorithms in C or Python|
|**Months 10–12**|Optimization + Integration Project|Build a small economic-CS hybrid (e.g., a web app forecasting stock returns with ML)|

## 3. Study Tactics

- **Active problem-solving**: Don’t just watch lectures—do every exercise.
    
- **Teach to learn**: Explain tough proofs or code to a peer (or to ChatGPT!).
    
- **Flashcards**: For definitions (e.g., convexity, eigenvector) using spaced repetition.
    
- **Weekly syntheses**: At week’s end, write a one-page summary in English _and_ in French (e.g., “derivative (dérivée (f))”) to cement both language and concept.

## 4. Integration with Econ & CS

- **Econ application**: After each math module, pick a micro topic (utility maximization, demand estimation) and run a mini-case study in Python (with Jupyter).
    
- **CS application**: Code up an algorithm that uses the math you just learned (e.g., implement gradient descent from scratch).

## 5. Tools & Resources

- **Environments**: Anaconda (Python), RStudio, VS Code.
    
- **Collaboration**: Form a bi-weekly study “duo” on GitHub or GitLab to review each other’s code and proofs.
    
- **Certifications** (optional):
    
    - “Mathematics for Machine Learning” Specialization (Coursera)
        
    - “Algorithms” (Princeton, Coursera)

### Bottom Line

Treat math not as abstract theory but as a toolkit you’ll wield in real projects. Stick to the timeline, force yourself to build something with each new concept, and you’ll have the mathematical firepower to excel in both économie (f) and informatique (f).

Stay pragmatic, keep shipping, and you’ll own both fields.
