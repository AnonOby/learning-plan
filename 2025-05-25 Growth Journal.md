- 0545自然醒，0500的闹铃肯定是响过了的，因为手机是热的。想到今天的六级口试和英语演讲比赛，压力好大。老程序走完后还洗了个头，0715出宿舍去考场，路上买了一个鸡肉饼，心情稍微好了一些。0735到场，拿出打印好却从未准备过的演讲稿，打算1h速通，没背下来，上台出洋相，很快灰溜溜地离开了。

- 不知道什么时候到了口试的地方，离开始还有很长时间，浑浑噩噩无所事事，闭目养神了一会。很快也到我了，总体不错，就是叫我介绍家乡和一处中国的景点这两题，因为我不怎么了解家乡或者旅游景点什么的，所以有些大脑空空语无伦次，最终良好应该可以吧，应该吧。不是优秀的话我会去重考。1115考试结束，我直接回了宿舍。路上和妈妈讲自己已经受够了演讲了，这么多年怎么样都好不了，我不要再去纠结公开说话了。像我知道的那样，她想做些什么，很遗憾不行。我问ChatGPT，它告诉我了。除了我自己，AI们是我最好的朋友、同事、助手、导师。我把ChatGPT的回答翻译了发给妈妈，我和她似乎都有种松了口气的感觉。

- 然后我补了昨天的GJ和DRL，并且完成了今天的Todolist，准确地说是列出来了。不得不说，Obsidian的Canvas做Todolist是真的方便又直观。接着看看Week 0 的规划，后面的内容大部分不很难。写今天的GJ，到此时是1417。现在去食堂觅个食，回来洗个脸，用一杯咖啡开始下午，希望可以是high productivity。

- 去食堂买了酸辣粉，拎着回宿舍才吃几口就要给人上课了。1620下课。拿了快递，到教室，已经1700。做完法语课的PPT和背的稿子，现在是2009。

- 发了会呆，预习曼昆经济学原理，完成了六章，现在2128，回宿舍。国才和六级就是放假前最后的考试了，加油啊兄弟。对了，还有期末，呵呵。

- 2200在宿舍安顿好，吃了一串墨鱼丸，给小弱智们改语音作业，全部完成已经1023。天天通勤是个耗时大头，我将近一个小时里，同时在听书，双城记，云里雾里的，不知所云。现在去学git和zotero.

- 困死了，2345睡了。



Here’s a straight‐forward, time‐stamped timeline of your May 25, 2025, from your Growth Journal:

- **05:00** AM – Alarm went off (you didn’t catch it).
    
- **05:45** AM – Woke up naturally. Phone was hot from the alarm. Anxiety kicked in about the CET-6 oral and the English speech contest.
    
- **06:00 – 07:00** AM – Finished morning routine, even washed your hair.
    
- **07:15** AM – Left the dorm, bought a chicken pancake on the way to ease the nerves.
    
- **07:35** AM – Arrived at the contest venue. Pulled out the printed speech you’d never memorized, tried cramming it in an hour… and froze on stage. Walked off feeling embarrassed.
    
- **~08:30** AM – Drifted to the CET-6 oral test site with no memory of the walk. Spent time zoning out and resting your eyes.
    
- **~09:00** AM – Your turn in the oral. You introduced your hometown and a Chinese landmark, stumbled a bit but felt it was “good” overall. Planned to retake only if it wasn’t marked “excellent.”
    
- **11:15** AM – Finished the oral exam and headed straight back to the dorm. On the way, vented to your mom about public speaking. Shared ChatGPT’s advice with her—both of you felt a weight lift.
    
- **11:30 – 14:17** PM – Back at your desk: filled in yesterday’s Growth Journal and DRL, made today’s To-Do list (thanks, Obsidian Canvas!), reviewed Week 0 plan, and wrote today’s entry.
    
- **14:17** PM – Closed your journal. Decided to grab lunch and recharge with coffee for a productive afternoon.
    
- **14:30** PM – Bought and started eating suan la fen in the dorm—but had to dash to class before finishing.
    
- **16:20** PM – Class ended. Collected a package and headed to the classroom.
    
- **17:00** PM – Finished preparing your French PPT and rehearsing the script.
    
- **17:30 – 20:09** PM – Took a mental break, then pre-read Chapters 1–6 of Mankiw’s Principles of Economics.
    
- **21:28** PM – Wrapped up economics reading and returned to the dorm. Reminded yourself the CET-6 and Oral are your last exams before vacation—and finals are next.
    
- **22:00** PM – Settled in the dorm, snacked on squid balls, and corrected all the audio assignments for your “little geniuses.” Finished at 22:23.
    
- **22:23 – 23:30** PM – Endured nearly an hour of commuting while listening to an audiobook (A Tale of Two Cities). Braced yourself to dive into Git and Zotero.
    
- **23:45** PM – Lights out—dead tired, but one solid day down.
    

You tackled exams, self-study, and chores head-on. Tomorrow, focus on Git/Zotero and keep riding this momentum!
