Great! Let’s refine your plan, focusing on trimming the scope and adding some fail-safes to address the cracks. Here’s how we’ll do it:

---

### **Revised Plan:**

### 1. **Clear, Focused Deliverables**

Instead of spreading yourself thin, let’s define **3 key outputs** that can be easily handled within the timeframe. Prioritize **impact** over quantity:

1. **Comparative Report** (SWOT for each agency, 3–4 key metrics)
    
    - Final output: A concise, 3-page report comparing 3 agencies on **management approach**, **marketing strategy**, and **student onboarding processes**.
        
    - **Rationale:** This can be quickly drawn from your interviews and serves as a strategic insight piece.
        
2. **Data Visualization (1 Key Chart)**
    
    - Final output: 1 chart (e.g., “Marketing Spend vs. Inquiries Generated by Agency”) with interpretation.
        
    - **Rationale:** Focus on one strong visual instead of trying to create a full dashboard, which would take longer than necessary.
        
3. **Bilingual Executive Summary** (English/French)
    
    - Final output: A 1-page, clear summary in English and French, providing high-level insights on key trends across agencies.
        
    - **Rationale:** Demonstrates both your language ability and synthesis skills.
        

By narrowing down to just **one chart**, **one report**, and **one summary**, you will be able to deliver substantial value without overloading your team.

### 2. **Revised Timeline**

Let’s focus on **high-impact weeks**, reducing the load while keeping everything realistic.

|Week|Tasks|
|---|---|
|**Week 1 (May 25–31)**|- Finalize 3–4 agencies to visit.- Send outreach emails/messages (clearly state how it benefits them, e.g., share comparative insights).- Schedule interviews (set dates & times).- Finalize team roles (RACI chart).|
|**Week 2 (Jun 1–7)**|- Conduct **4 interviews**. Focus on recording detailed, structured notes.- Share raw notes with team for quick feedback.- Start organizing notes into the SWOT matrix.- Create a shared Google Form or Airtable to standardize interview data capture.|
|**Week 3 (Jun 8–14)**|- Conduct remaining **3 interviews**.- Finalize the **SWOT analysis** (use Google Sheets to summarize data).- Use **Google Data Studio** or **Excel** to start crafting **1 key chart**.- Draft **1-page executive summary** (bilingual).|
|**Week 4 (Jun 15–21)**|- Finalize the **comparative report** (3–4 pages) using the SWOT and chart.- Polish the **bilingual summary**.- Review project with mentor/peers—solicit feedback.- Make final tweaks and prepare **presentation**.|
|**Jun 22–24**|- Final rehearsal of your presentation.- Prepare to share your final deliverables with agencies (optional, if applicable).|

### 3. **Team Coordination—Structure & Tools**

Don’t let team tasks fall into chaos. Use these tools for smooth workflow:

1. **RACI Chart (Roles Defined)**  
    This keeps everyone on the same page. Here’s a basic chart:
    

|Task/Role|You (Leader)|Member 1|Member 2|Member 3|Member 4|Member 5|Member 6|Member 7|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Interview Preparation|A|R|C|C|C|C|C|C|
|Interviewing|R|A|A|C|C|C|C|C|
|Data Capture (Forms)|A|C|C|R|C|C|C|C|
|SWOT Analysis|A|R|C|C|C|C|C|C|
|Bilingual Summary Writing|A|R|C|C|C|C|C|C|
|Visualization Creation|A|C|C|R|C|C|C|C|
|Final Report Drafting|A|C|C|C|C|R|C|C|

**Legend:**

- **R:** Responsible (does the work)
    
- **A:** Accountable (final decision maker)
    
- **C:** Consulted (provides feedback or expertise)
    

2. **Google Forms / Airtable**
    
    - Create a **Google Form** with standardized questions (ensure each member is filling it out for consistency). Share this link before the interviews.
        
    - Alternatively, set up an **Airtable base** for more structured data, including drop-downs for common themes.
        
3. **Communication Channels**
    
    - Create a **WeChat or Slack group** for all team members.
        
    - Share weekly reminders and check-ins to keep the team on track.

### 4. **Risk Management—Backup Plans**

Here’s how to mitigate common risks:

1. **Agency Cancellations:**
    
    - Have **2–3 backup agencies** ready to go.
        
    - Don’t rely on just cold outreach—contact them through LinkedIn, local networks, or any faculty connections.
        
2. **Interview No-Shows:**
    
    - Set a **reminder** 24 hours before each interview (email or message). If someone can’t make it, have another team member ready to step in.
        
3. **Data Inconsistencies:**
    
    - Use the **Google Forms/Airtable** to ensure consistency from the start—no more manual cleanup. This eliminates errors in raw data input.
        
4. **Team Coordination Breakdown:**
    
    - Send **task reminders** and create clear deadlines in your shared group (e.g., “by this Friday, everyone should submit their SWOT analysis drafts for review”).

### 5. **Ethical & Consent Considerations**

- **Consent Forms:** Ensure you have a **one-page consent form** for each interviewee. Include clear points like:
    
    - Purpose of the interview
        
    - Recording notice
        
    - How the data will be used
        
    - Contact info for follow-ups
        

**Where to get consent:**

- Google Forms with a checkbox for consent (if you’re recording interviews).
    
- Or ask interviewees to digitally sign a PDF version if they’re willing.

### 6. **Midpoint Check-ins and Feedback Loops**

- **Midpoint Review (Week 3):**  
    Set up a **check-in with your mentor or faculty advisor**. Present your SWOT findings, chart, and any early drafts of the report. Use their feedback to adjust your direction before the final week.
    
- **Team Feedback:**  
    At the end of Week 3, hold a **peer review session** where everyone gives feedback on each other’s work. Ensure you’re all aligned on the final report and presentation format.

### 7. **Final Deliverables and Presentation**

For your final deliverables and presentation:

1. **Comparative Report (SWOT)**
    
    - 3–4 pages, including analysis and a recommendation section.
        
    - **Tip:** Keep it visual! Incorporate key charts and bullet points.
        
2. **Bilingual Summary**
    
    - A concise 1-page high-level summary in English and French, focusing on the most important insights for each agency.
        
3. **Presentation**
    
    - Use **Google Slides or PowerPoint**. Make it clear, with clean visuals of the chart, SWOT matrix, and your final conclusions.
        
    - Present in English (with key phrases in French for flair), practicing the **STAR method** for each answer.
