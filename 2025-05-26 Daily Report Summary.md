## **Daily Template**

1. **Today’s Tasks**
    
    - **French (Français)**:
        
        - Basic class: archived 4–5 vocab/grammar points in Obsidian, resolved grading issues.
            
        - Oral class: planned active participation, reflected on Sandy’s feedback.
            
    - **English (Anglais)**:
        
        - Indirect use via English-language CS/Econ resources and Git/Zotero documentation.
            
    - **Economics (Économie)**:
        
        - Previewed Mankiw Ch.7–19: supply/demand, market efficiency, public sector, firm behavior.
            
    - **Computer Science (Informatique)**:
        
        - Git practice: branch merging, conflict resolution (17:10–19:00; 20:26–21:31).
            
        - Zotero setup: Chrome/Obsidian/Word integrations; imported core textbooks.
            
    - **Mathematics (Mathématiques)**:
        
        - No direct study—added textbooks to Zotero for future study.
            
    - **Self-Management**:
        
        - Optimized Obsidian note-taking, overcame midday fatigue, improvised solutions in unexpected situations.
            
2. **Progress**
    
    - Successfully consolidated key French points and built note archives.
        
    - Strengthened cross-disciplinary English expertise through tool usage.
        
    - Established economic groundwork by previewing 13 chapters.
        
    - Elevated version-control proficiency and research-management workflows.
        
    - Identified gaps in math practice and sleep discipline.
        
3. **Challenges**
    
    - Woke up 30 min late due to sleep debt, shifting morning schedule.
        
    - No dedicated math session—risk of falling behind.
        
    - Physical tension (neck/eyes) from extended screen time.
        
    - Distracted multitasking during French oral class.
        
4. **Tomorrow’s Plan**
    
    - **Math**: 30 min problem set on foundational concepts.
        
    - **VS Code**: 20 min exploration of extensions and terminal.
        
    - **French Oral**: Volunteer for at least 2 speaking exercises; use Obsidian only for class notes.
        
    - **Sleep & Wake**: 23:00 wind-down alarm; 5:00 AM wake-up protocol with alarm across room.
        
    - **Routine Habits**: Hourly 5-min stretch/eye-rest breaks; Bloomberg listening during commute.
        
    - **Workflow Automation**: Draft a Python script to sync Zotero updates into Obsidian.
