#### Next Steps for Week 1 Planning (planification pour la Semaine 1 (f.))

- Use the **Notion template** (_modèle Notion_ (m.)) on Saturday 16:00–17:00 to document these points and share with ChatGPT/Grok.
    
- Block Week 1 sessions in Google **Calendar** (_calendrier_ (m.)) on Sunday 19:00–20:00:
    
    1. **Economic Theory** (_théorie économique_ (f.)): 08:00–10:00 daily, with explicit tasks (“Solve Mankiw Ch.3 Q1–5”).
        
    2. **MATLAB Practice** (_pratique MATLAB_ (f.)): 16:15–18:15 daily, starting with `matrix_practice.m`.
        
    3. **C Exercises** (_exercices C_ (m.)): 14:00–16:00 daily, “Complete 2 K&R exercises per 25m Pomodoro block.”
        

By retroactively summarizing and scheduling Week 1 with clear micro-outputs, you transform vague intentions into actionable steps.




Below is a **rigorous, itemized comparison** of your **Week 0 Plan** versus **Actual Execution (23–31 May 2025)**, listing every task you should have completed but missed. I’ve cross-referenced all 8 components of the plan against your daily logs.  

---

### **1. Goal Clarification & Breakdown**  
**Planned:**  
- [x] Create Obsidian/Notion page listing 3 long-term goals (color-coded).  
- [x] Define semester/yearly milestones in a table.  
**Missed:**  
- ❌ **No long-term goals page created** (mentioned in plan but absent in logs).  
- ❌ **Milestone table never built** (no Obsidian/Notion artifacts for 2026/2027 targets).  

---

### **2. Learning Environment & Tool Setup**  
**Planned:**  
- [x] Install MATLAB + run sample scripts.  
- [x] Configure C environment (GCC/Clang, VS Code extensions).  
- [x] Initialize React app with `create-react-app`.  
- [x] Install MySQL/PostgreSQL + create `practice_db`.  
- [x] Push `learning-plan` repo to GitHub.  
- [x] Build Obsidian vault `Lifelong Learning` with 3 folders.  
- [x] Design Notion calendar + daily log template.  
**Missed:**  
- ❌ **MATLAB sample scripts never run** (only installed; no `*.m` files executed).  
- ❌ **React app not initialized** (studied concepts but no `my-app` project created).  
- ❌ **No SQL database created** (`practice_db` missing; zero SQL logs).  
- ❌ **Incomplete Obsidian structure**: Vault not named `Lifelong Learning`; `Projects` folder missing.  
- ❌ **Notion calendar not designed** (daily logs were Markdown files, not Notion).  

---

### **3. Resource Collection & Planning**  
**Planned:**  
- [x] Outline Mankiw textbook preface + TOC.  
- [x] Enroll in MIT OCW 14.01 + import materials.  
- [x] Bookmark Udemy/Coursera full-stack courses.  
- [x] Create Obsidian "Resources" page (categorized by theme).  
**Missed:**  
- ❌ **Mankiw preface/TOC not outlined** (pre-read Ch. 1–19 but no structured outline).  
- ❌ **Full-stack tutorials unbookmarked** (only studied MongoDB/React.js ad hoc).  
- ❌ **No Obsidian "Resources" page** (materials scattered, no centralized catalog).  

---

### **4. Self-Evaluation & Baseline Testing**  
**Planned:**  
- [x] Solve Mankiw Ch. 1–3 exercises + document approach.  
- [x] Create 20+ economics MCQs in Quizlet.  
- [x] Write/run C program asking for user’s name (`hello.c` extended).  
- [x] Run MATLAB matrix script:  
  ```matlab
  A = [1 2; 3 4]; B = inv(A); disp(B);
  ```  
- [x] Commit/push baseline code to GitHub.  
**Missed:**  
- ❌ **Zero Mankiw exercises solved** (passive reading only).  
- ❌ **Quizlet MCQs never created**.  
- ❌ **C `hello.c` extension not written** (built converter but skipped name-input task).  
- ❌ **MATLAB matrix script never run** (no `.m` files in logs).

---

- [x] Block time in calendar app (Mon–Sun slots).  
- [x] Use Pomodoro + alarms.  
**Missed:**  
- ❌ **MATLAB allocation = 0h** (vs. 10h planned).  
- ❌ **Full-stack allocation = 1h** (vs. 10h planned).

**Missed:**  
- ❌ **No weekly summary created** (30–31 May collapsed).  
- ❌ **Mentor not engaged** (zero shares).  
- ❌ **Week 1 not planned** (no calendar blocks or task definitions).  

---

### **Critical Path Failures**  
1. **MATLAB Abandonment**:  
   - Should have run `matrix_practice.m` → committed to GitHub.  
2. **Econ Practice Void**:  
   - Should have solved 20+ Mankiw exercises → logged in Obsidian.  
3. **Community Radio Silence**:  
   - Should have published CSDN log + asked Stack Overflow question.  
4. **Sleep Sabotage**:  
   - Should have enabled app blockers at 22:30.  

---

### **Why This Matters**  
> *« Ce qui ne se mesure pas ne s’améliore pas. »*  
> *(What isn’t measured isn’t improved.)*  
Your Week 0 plan was a **masterpiece of intent**—but execution became a **collage of avoidance**. June demands:  
1. **Atomic Outputs**:  
   - Replace "Study MATLAB" with **"Run `matrix_practice.m` → push to GitHub."**  
2. **Public Accountability**:  
   - Publish logs every Friday on CSDN.  
3. **Zero-Day Protection**:  
   - If you code/write <1h by 12:00 PM, trigger emergency focus session.  





### **General Assessment: Precision of Intent vs. Fragility of Execution**  
Your journey from **23–31 May 2025** reveals a sharp dichotomy:  
**Strengths in structure, weaknesses in follow-through.**  

#### **1. Core Tensions Identified**  
| **Planning Genius**              | **Execution Gaps**                |  
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|  
| ✅ **Tool Mastery**: Obsidian, Git, Zotero operationalized. | ❌ **Avoided Critical Work**: MATLAB untouched, econ exercises skipped. |  
| ✅ **Resource Curation**: MIT OCW, K&R, Mankiw acquired. | ❌ **Passive Consumption**: Pre-reading ≠ mastery; no applied problem-solving. |  
| ✅ **Schedule Crafting**: Detailed daily blocks defined. | ❌ **Time Allocation Collapse**: 0/10h MATLAB, 1/10h full-stack. |  
| ✅ **Self-Awareness**: Logged lapses (Bilibili, sleep) honestly. | ❌ **No Consequence Engine**: Skipped tasks had no recovery mechanism. |  

#### **2. Root Cause Diagnosis**  
- **Output Ambiguity**:  
  Planned "study economics" instead of **"solve Mankiw Ch.3 Q1–5 + log answers."** Vagueness bred avoidance.  
- **Comfort-Zone Bias**:  
  Prioritized familiar tasks (C debugging, French notes) over high-resistance work (MATLAB, econ math).  
- **Tool Fetishization**:  
  Spent 12h+ tuning Obsidian/Zotero to avoid the discomfort of *doing the actual work*.  
- **Accountability Vacuum**:  
  Zero community/mentor engagement → no external pressure to ship outputs.  

#### **3. The Hidden Cost**  
Your **"invisible debt"** compounds:  
- Skipped MATLAB practice → Delayed project portfolio.  
- Unvalidated econ knowledge → Weak foundations for econometrics.  
- Unpushed code → Silent GitHub → Missed job opportunities.

### **Prescription: The June 2025 Reset**  
#### **Non-Negotiable Shifts**  
1. **Atomic Outputs Over Activities**:  
   - Replace *"Study MATLAB"* with → **"Run `matrix_practice.m` → commit to GitHub before lunch."**  
   - Replace *"Review econ"* with → **"Solve 5 Mankiw Ch.4 problems → log in Obsidian."**  
2. **Public Accountability Rituals**:  
   - **Monday 08:00**: Publish weekly plan on CSDN.  
   - **Friday 17:00**: Share GitHub commit graph + 1 shipped output with mentor.  
3. **Defend the Keystone Habit**:  
   - **Sleep at 22:30**: Enable app blockers at 22:00; phone in another room.  
   - **No Zero Days**: If output <1h by 12:00 PM, trigger 90m emergency focus session.  

#### **Mindset Mantra**  
> *« Je ne planifie pas pour éviter l’action ; j’agis pour valider le plan. »*  
> *(I do not plan to avoid action; I act to validate the plan.)*  

---

### **Final Insight**  
You built a **launchpad** (tools/resources/schedules) but hesitated to **ignite**. June must be the month you transcend planning aesthetics and embrace the friction of creation. The difference between aspiration and achievement lies not in your ability to *design* systems, but to *defend* them against your own avoidance.  

**Start today**: Run the MATLAB script you skipped in Week 0. Commit it. Push it. Tag me in the log.  
*On ne remet pas à demain ce qu’on peut faire aujourd’hui.* 🔥
