You’ve set yourself an ambitious path—French major, a rock-solid undergrad plan, and no master’s degree—and you’re wondering if that’s enough to land your “dream job,” and whether employers will pigeonhole you because of your background. Here’s the unvarnished, forward-looking take:

1. **Dream jobs live or die by skills, not diplomas**
    
    - Many companies today care far more about what you can _do_ than what hangs on your wall. If your undergrad action plan gave you real deliverables—say, a portfolio of full-stack projects, economic analyses, bilingual presentations—that’s pure gold.
        
    - **Action:** Build a small GitHub repo or personal website that highlights 3–5 flagship projects combining your French language skills with economic or tech applications.
        
2. **No master’s? No deal? Not necessarily.**
    
    - In fields like software development and data analysis, _practical_ mastery often outweighs formal credentials. If you can write clean code in C or MATLAB, deploy a web app, or model an economic scenario in Python, employers will sit up and take notice.
        
    - **Action:** Pursue targeted certifications (e.g. AWS Developer, Google Data Analytics) or MOOCs with verifiable certificates. They fill the “no master’s” gap with proof of contemporary skills.
        
3. **Leveraging your French major as a unique asset**
    
    - Being truly bilingual at C1–C2 level in both English and French (français [masculine]) is rare. You can niche into roles requiring multicultural communication: UX research for Francophone markets, localization engineering, cross-border e-commerce, or economic consulting on French-speaking regions.
        
    - **Action:** Identify 2–3 industries (e.g. fintech in Paris, international NGOs, global supply-chain firms) and tailor your résumé to emphasize your language-plus-tech-plus-econ trifecta.
        
4. **Discrimination risks—and how to defuse them**
    
    - Yes, some employers still filter résumés by “Master’s required.” Others may doubt a “language major” can code. That’s their loss—and yours if you don’t pre-empt it.
        
    - **Mitigation:**
        
        1. **Quantify** your achievements (“Reduced load time by 40%”; “Authored a 20-page market-entry report in French”).
            
        2. **Testimonials**—letters from project supervisors or professors who attest to your technical and analytical chops.
            
        3. **Network** with alumni and on LinkedIn; a referral neutralizes many unconscious biases.
            
5. **Straight to the point: Your next 3 steps**
    
    1. **Portfolio polish**: Pick one economic model and one web app that both use French (e.g., a dashboard showing French GDP growth). Host them live.
        
    2. **Certify**: In the next 3 months, earn at least one industry certificate that aligns with your target role.
        
    3. **Pitch**: Write a concise 30-second pitch in French and English explaining who you are, what unique problem you solve, and why you’re the right hire—then practice it with mentors.
        

**Bottom line:** You won’t be automatically disqualified for lacking a master’s—if you back your French degree with demonstrable, up-to-date skills and a clear value proposition, you’ll stand out, not out-classed. Keep grinding on real projects, get those badges of competence, and you’ll be on solid footing to claim the career you’ve envisioned.
