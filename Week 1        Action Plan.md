**Week 1 (June 2–June 8, 2025) • “Unscheduled” Task List**

Below is a consolidated, itemized list of everything you need to accomplish during Week 1—no specific time slots, only “things to do.” This combines your overarching undergraduate action plan (core courses, certifications, math, languages, projects) with the gaps identified in Week 0.
