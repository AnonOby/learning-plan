## **Subject Performance Ratings (0–5)**

1. **French (français m.)**: **5/5**
    
    - **Justification**: Full mastery of presentation script (“读得很熟练”), new vocabulary retention (“完成单词默写，身心舒畅”), and consistent practice.
        
2. **National English Test (国才 anglais m.)**: **4/5**
    
    - **Justification**: Completed three full essays and two oral tasks confidently (“挺轻松的”), but interpretation practice was only 30 min—room to extend duration.
        
3. **Mathematics (mathématiques f.)**: **2.5/5**
    
    - **Justification**: Solved 10 basic linear algebra problems but struggled significantly (“做得很费劲”), indicating foundational gaps that need reinforcement.
        
4. **Coursera (PPT Course) (informatique f.)**: **3/5**
    
    - **Justification**: Dedicated ~2 h under suboptimal network conditions, demonstrating perseverance, but retention was compromised by fatigue (“有点困”), and actual progress was limited.
        
5. **Self-Management & Well-being (autodiscipline f. & bien-être m.)**: **5/5**
    
    - **Justification**: Perfect execution of Pomodoro technique (7 h 30 m of focused work), healthy breaks (walk during power outage), and strong boundary setting (“有事明早再弄”).

## **General Dimension Ratings (0–5)**

1. **Consistency & Schedule Adherence (cohérence f.)**: **4/5**
    
    - **Justification**: Maintained morning routine and Pomodoro blocks as planned. Minor deviations occurred due to network/power outages and a prolonged programming attempt.
        
2. **Mood (état d’esprit m.)**: **4/5**
    
    - **Justification**: High positive energy overall (“精力充沛”), with only brief frustration during math and programming, but no marked emotional downturn.
        
3. **Motivation & Drive (motivation f.)**: **5/5**
    
    - **Justification**: Logged 7.5 h of intensive work across five areas despite obstacles, pivoted quickly when blocked, and preserved a forward-focused mindset.
        
4. **Tool/Skill Milestone Progress (jalon d’outils/compétences f.)**: **4/5**
    
    - **Justification**: Mastery of Pomodoro technique and French vocabulary recall, plus initial groundwork in linear algebra. Slight loss of efficiency in programming.
        
5. **Use of Breaks & Recovery (gestion du repos f.)**: **4.5/5**
    
    - **Justification**: Effective walk (active rest) and audiobook integration, though felt fatigued during the Coursera session—suggesting minor adjustments needed.
        
6. **Handling Unplanned Disruptions (gestion de l’imprévu f.)**: **3.5/5**
    
    - **Justification**: Adapted to network and power issues rapidly, but still allowed reactive task-hopping (programming attempt) to cost ~1 h.

**4. What worked / what didn’t?**

- **✅ What Worked Well**
    
    1. **Energy & Routine Management**
        
        - Slept until 07:30 → woke up “精力充沛” and used Red Bull/quick morning routine to jumpstart work.
            
        - Pomodoro intervals kept “高密度工作” sustained across subjects.
            
    2. **Language Progress**
        
        - French presentation practice → achieved fluency (“读得很熟练”).
            
        - 国才 oral practice → boosted confidence (“挺轻松的”).
            
    3. **Adaptive Breaks**
        
        - Mid-day walk (18:10–18:40) after dinner provided a mental reset, especially important when the classroom lost power.
            
    4. **Boundary Setting**
        
        - Stopped at 23:50 (“有事明早再弄”), preventing burnout and preserving next-day freshness.
            
- **❌ What Didn’t Work Well**
    
    1. **Programming Attempt**
        
        - Trying to write a random-number program at 10:00 ended in “一败涂地,” wasted ~1 h before seeking help.
            
    2. **Technical & Logistical Hurdles**
        
        - Coursera PPT segment knocked off by network issues; class power outage forced relocation, costing time and momentum.
            
    3. **Ignoring Fatigue Signals**
        
        - Pushed through Coursera module from 13:39–15:45 despite feeling “有点困,” likely reducing retention.
            
    4. **Math Struggle**
        
        - Spent 125 min (18:40–20:45) on very basic linear algebra, describing it as “做得很费劲,” indicating inefficient use of that slot.

**5. What from today can you apply tomorrow? (rétention et application f.)**

1. **Front-load High-Cognition Work**
    
    - Tackle linear algebra problems **before lunch** when energy peaked today (0730–1200).
        
2. **Pomodoro Continuation**
    
    - Maintain 25/5 intervals for 国才 writing and French dictation; preserve midday walk as active recovery.
        
3. **Pre-check Technical Logistics**
    
    - Verify classroom power/network by early morning (e.g., check backup points at 08:00) to avoid surprise relocations.
        
4. **5-Minute Limit on Coding Attempts**
    
    - If random-number or other programming tasks stall past 5 min, pivot immediately to a backup (e.g., French vocab review) to avoid wasted time.

**6. How consistent were you with your schedule? (autodiscipline f. & cohérence f.)**  
**Rating: 4/5 (Above Expectations)**

- **Strengths**
    
    - Morning routine and Pomodoro blocks executed as planned.
        
    - Completed all core study goals across five subjects within planned time windows.
        
- **Deviations**
    
    - Network outage during Coursera caused a switch to French earlier than intended.
        
    - Unexpected classroom power failure forced relocation (18:10–18:40).

**7. How did you feel mentally/physically? (bien-être m. & équilibre m.)**

- **Mental**
    
    - **Morning**: “精力充沛，心灵上的倦怠一扫而尽” → high confidence and clarity.
        
    - **Late Morning**: Brief frustration with programming (“一败涂地”), but quickly rebounded into positive momentum on French.
        
    - **Afternoon**: Felt “有点困” during Coursera, yet persevered through 国才 writing and oral with “挺轻松的” attitude.
        
    - **Evening**: Mild discouragement in math (“做得很费劲”), balanced by satisfaction from completing problems and practicing 国才.
        
    - **Night**: Calm boundary at 23:50 (“有事明早再弄”) contributed to restful mindset.
        
- **Physical**
    
    - **Early Morning**: Despite alarm at 05:00, waking at 07:30 left energy levels high (“精力充沛”).
        
    - **Midday**: Brunch at 08:50 avoided crowds, stabilized blood sugar.
        
    - **Afternoon**: Felt drowsiness from 13:39–15:45 during Coursera—signal to integrate short nap or lighter task next time.
        
    - **Evening**: Active walk from 18:10–18:40 served as restorative break when classroom lost power.
        
    - **Late Night**: Routine (22:50–23:50) provided necessary wind-down; prepared body for sleep.

> **Overall Insight:** You demonstrated **strong self-management** (Pomodoro, boundary setting) and **high motivation** despite technical/logistical friction. Prioritizing peak-energy tasks in the morning and protecting those time blocks will be critical going forward—keep sharpening your execution on unplanned disruptions.
