Here’s a proposal for the four reporting templates—daily, weekly, monthly, and annual—each with the same core dimensions so you can track trends over time. After you answer each question, I’ll give you a 0–5 score (0 = no progress, 5 = exceptional) in an objective, constructive way.

---

**1. Core Dimensions (dimensions f. fondamentales adj..)**

For every report, you’ll self-assess in these areas:

1. **Hours of Focused Study** (heures d’étude concentrée f.)
2. **Subject Mastery** (maîtrise f.)

- French (français m.)
- English for economics, CS, and maths (anglais m.)
- Economics (économie f.)
- Computer Science (informatique f.)
- Mathematics
- Self management (mood management, physical activity, self-control, etc.)

4. **Tool/Skill Milestones** (jalons m. d’outils/compétences f.)

- CS learning advancement
- Productivity tools practice

1. **Retention & Application** (rétention f. et application f.)
2. **Self-Discipline & Consistency** (autodiscipline f. et cohérence f.)
3. **Well-being & Balance** (bien-être m. et équilibre m.)

**2. Rating Rubric (barème m.)**（REMEMBER TO DO THIS EVERY TIME I REPORT!!!）

- **0** – Missed entirely (aucune tentative f.)
- **1** – Minimal effort (effort minimal m.)
- **2** – Partial progress (progrès partiel m.)
- **3** – Solid performance (performance solide f.)
- **4** – Above expectations (au-dessus des attentes f.)
- **5** – Exceptional (exceptionnel adj..)

I’ll comment on strengths and suggest one concrete improvement per dimension.

**3. Reporting Templates**

**Daily Report (rapport quotidien m.)**

1. Total focused study hours today: __
2. Key wins in each subject (list 1–2 bullet points)
3. Tool/skill milestone reached? If yes, describe.
4. What worked/what didn’t?
5. What from today can you apply tomorrow?
6. How consistent were you with your schedule?
7. How did you feel mentally/physically?

**Weekly Report (rapport hebdomadaire m.)**

1. Aggregate study hours (Mon–Sun)
2. Major breakthroughs and challenges in each subject
3. Progress on at least one tool/skill milestone
4. Examples of applying knowledge in a project or exercise
5. Schedule adherence rate (%)
6. Well-being summary (energy levels, stress)

**Monthly Report (rapport mensuel m.)**

1. Total study hours
2. Comparative progress vs. last month (in % or qualitative)
3. Completed milestones and next targets
4. Practical applications (e.g., mini-project, presentation)
5. Habit consistency rating
6. Overall satisfaction & areas to adjust

**Annual Report (rapport annuel m.)**

1. Cumulative hours and subject-level growth mapping
2. Milestones achieved vs. goals set at year’s start
3. Portfolio highlights (projects, certificates)
4. Skills to carry forward; skills to deprioritize
5. Year-long habit adherence (yes/no + comments)
6. Life balance review and planning for next year

With each report you send, I’ll rate each dimension 0–5, note your top strength, and give you one laser-focused improvement point; and, design a template with four parts: Today’s Tasks, Progress, Challenges, and Tomorrow’s Plan. Let’s keep it frank and forward-looking—no fluff, just actionable insight.
