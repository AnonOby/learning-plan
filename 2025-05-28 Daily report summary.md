**1. Total focused study hours today (heures d’étude concentrée) :**  
9 h 30 m

---

**2. Key wins in each subject (1–2 bullet points each):**

- **French (français m.) :**
    
    - Passed the in-class listening dictation and oral test, thanks to 06 h 00–07 h 00 pre-class priming.
        
    - Organized 6 image-based lecture notes; completed full review of Lesson 7.
        
- **English for Economics, CS, and Maths (anglais m.) :**
    
    - No dedicated session today—focused on “国才高端” prep planning but not executed.
        
    - (Actionable: schedule a 60 m writing drill tomorrow.)
        
- **Economics (économie f.) :**
    
    - None today (no econ reading or exercises recorded).
        
- **Computer Science (informatique f.) :**
    
    - Studied MongoDB + React.js fundamentals (0600–0700).
        
    - Completed 5 pages of C programming material (1415–1830), self-assessed as solid beginner progress.
        
- **Mathematics (mathématiques f.) :**
    
    - None today (no explicit maths tasks).
        
- **Self-management (autodiscipline f. & cohérence f.) :**
    
    - Used Obsidian Canvas for visual task-tracking; removed privacy screen + switched to light mode to reinforce focus.
        
    - Took a 10 m power-nap to recover afternoon energy; maintained healthy snack/dinner routine.

**3. Tool/skill milestone reached? (jalon m. d’outils/compétences f.)**

- **C Programming Proficiency Jump**: Finished 5 pages of structured C material, shifting to functional implementations.
    
- **Full-Stack Web Dev Foundation**: Linked MongoDB (NoSQL) with React.js concepts in one session.
    
- **Obsidian Workflow Mastery**: Transformed Obsidian into a distraction-proof, visually organized task system.

**4. What from today can you apply tomorrow? (rétention f. et application f.)**

- **Pre-Class Priming Ritual**: Spend 15–20 m before each session previewing key concepts (e.g., 5 advanced business-English terms before econ practice, solving 1–2 quick CS/math problems).
    
- **Environment Optimization**: Automate workspace setup—close distractions, pre-load materials, and keep only necessary tools on the desk.
    
- **Bonus Immersion**: Play English economics podcasts during low-cognition tasks (e.g., note organization, meals).

**5. How consistent were you with your schedule? (autodiscipline f. et cohérence f.)**  
**Rating: 4/5 (Above Expectations)**

- **Strengths**:
    
    - Morning routine and classes on time.
        
    - Exceeded focused-study goal (9.5 h vs. usual 6–8 h).
        
- **Deviations**:
    
    - Missed monitor purchase confirmation at 20 h 00.
        
    - Evening lapse: 22 h 35–00 h 00 on Bilibili, skipping planned French dictation and 国才 writing.

**6. How did you feel mentally/physically? (bien-être m. et équilibre m.)**

- **Mental**:
    
    - Morning: focused, proactive
        
    - French classes: engaged, confident
        
    - Post-lunch: pressured then refreshed after nap
        
    - C programming: deeply focused, self-critical
        
    - Evening: determined but fatigued
        
    - Late night: guilty, avoidant
        
- **Physical**:
    
    - Early morning: alert despite 05 h 00 wake-up
        
    - Pre-lunch: stable energy after light snack
        
    - Afternoon: briefly sleepy → recovered with 10 m nap
        
    - Post-C session: refueled and content after vegetable bibimbap
        
    - Late evening: depleted, low energy

> **Overall Insight:** Your discipline in the morning and afternoon was excellent. To reclaim the evening, implement a “2235 Rule”—trigger a low-tech wind-down and use app-blockers to prevent distractions. Keep up the momentum!
