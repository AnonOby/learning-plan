Here’s the unvarnished take: even if “just” English teaching isn’t your dream role, this internship could still move your long-term plan forward—if you treat it strategically. Let’s break it down.

**1. Extract transferable skills**

* **Cross-cultural communication:** Teaching English in a study-abroad context will sharpen your ability to bridge cultural gaps—an asset for any future role in international education, economic research, or full-stack teams at global companies.
* **Project management & organization:** Lesson planning, classroom coordination and tracking student progress all build your planning muscles. Those same muscles will serve you when you’re designing economic models or coding a complex app.
* **Networking:** You’ll get to know staff and partner schools, potentially opening doors to project-based work in program design, marketing or operations—roles more tightly aligned with economics or tech.

**2. Negotiate scope**
Before you commit, see if you can:

* Take on a “mini-project” alongside teaching—perhaps translating marketing materials into French, helping set up a CRM or website update, or analyzing student-placement data (basic Excel or SQL).
* Shadow colleagues in admissions or partnerships for a few hours weekly.
* Deliver a short workshop in French (your growing strength) on cultural adaptation or study-abroad tips.

**3. Complement with self-directed work**
You still have 50 hours/week free for self-study—use evenings or weekends to:

* Prototype a simple web app (your full-stack track) that could solve a real pain point you spot in the agency’s process.
* Build a mini economic survey on student preferences and present your findings—great résumé booster.

**Questions to sharpen my advice:**

1. What exactly would your day-to-day teaching duties be? (number of classes, prep time, age group)
2. How flexible is the agency on role scope—have they hinted at any side-projects?
3. What specific skills or résumé lines do you most want to strengthen this summer?

Let’s zero in on your priorities and scope before you decide. No sugarcoating: if it really offers zero relevant experience or networking, look elsewhere—bad internships waste time. But if you can bend the role even slightly toward economics, management or tech, it can become a springboard rather than a detour.
